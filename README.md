A website for a local charity organisation. (To replace http://sagns.org)

Currently availble to view at [https://sagns.netlify.com](https://sagns.netlify.com)

## Maintaining this site

Maintiaining this site will require either content management or code development. Most updates should only need to performed as content management.


### Content Management

The content for the site is updateable without the need to write code thanks to a simple CMS (content management system) provided by [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifyCMS.com).


### Code development

This site is a static web site generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.io).


### Project bootstrapping

To build this site you should first checkout this git repository, and then ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

With these prerequisites installed, you can install all other dependencies with:

`yarn`

You can start a watcher task to automatically compile and serve the site locally with `yarn start`.

A build task outputs as deployable site asset via the command `yarn run build`. This is the task triggered automatically on the Netlify hosting environment.


### Deployment

Code and content deployments are performed via git commits to this repository. Any commit pushes to the `master` branch of this repository will trigger an automatic build and deployment by Netlify.

Builds typically take a few seconds and updates should usually be visible in the live site within a minute of making the change.


## Hosting

The live site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) as a static web site and visible online at [https://sagns.netlify.com](https://sagns.netlify.com).

Feature branches can be deployed on Netlify for testing. Any git branch pushed to this repository will become available for testing at `https://{BRANCH-NAME}--sagns.netlify.com`

Source code for the site is hosted on Github at [https://github.com/philhawksworth/sagns.com](https://github.com/philhawksworth/sagns.com)
